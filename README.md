Animated ()

Static (1)



<% include Animated data="link", width="", height="" %>



Bring in the bodymovin library:
- download the file (3)
- cdn (2)
- npm/yarn (1)
    - matches current workflow/build tooling
    - fixes to a version
    - sites with no build tooling

Require the bodymovin library:
- set path in template <script src="node_modules/{path}.js"></script> (3)
- set path in requirements Requirements::js(node_modules/{path}.js) (2)
- module imports (1)

How do we get json??
